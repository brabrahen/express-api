## express-api
In this project I build an API for a clothing store and probably will use with my friend in our store in the future.

To install all dependecies NPM INSTALL

NPM RUN DEV to run application

I have some problems using a "fake" DB, when was an array, but now I changed to MongoDB and it¬¥s running.
